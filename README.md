Code release for "DemoFusion: Democratising High-Resolution Image Generation With No üí∞" (arXiv 2023)

<img src="figures/illustration.jpg" width="800"/>

**Abstract**: High-resolution image generation with Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has immense potential but, due to the enormous capital investment required for training, it is increasingly centralised to a few large corporations, and hidden behind paywalls. This paper aims to democratise high-resolution GenAI by advancing the frontier of high-resolution generation while remaining accessible to a broad audience. We demonstrate that existing Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) possess untapped potential for higher-resolution image generation. Our novel DemoFusion framework seamlessly extends open-source GenAI models, employing Progressive Upscaling, Skip Residual, and Dilated Sampling mechanisms to achieve higher-resolution image generation. The progressive nature of DemoFusion requires more passes, but the intermediate results can serve as "previews", facilitating rapid prompt iteration.

## Starting with our code
### Hyper-parameters
- `view_batch_size` (`int`, defaults to 16):
  The batch size for multiple denoising paths. Typically, a larger batch size can result in higher efficiency but comes with increased GPU memory requirements.
- `stride` (`int`, defaults to 64):
  The stride of moving local patches. A smaller stride is better for alleviating seam issues, but it also introduces additional computational overhead and inference time.
- `cosine_scale_1` (`float`, defaults to 3):
  Control the decreasing rate of skip-residual. A smaller value results in better consistency with low-resolution results, but it may lead to more pronounced upsampling noise. Please refer to Appendix C in the DemoFusion paper.
- `cosine_scale_2` (`float`, defaults to 1):
  Control the decreasing rate of dilated sampling. A smaller value can better address the repetition issue, but it may lead to grainy images. For specific impacts, please refer to Appendix C in the DemoFusion paper.
- `cosine_scale_3` (`float`, defaults to 1):
  Control the decrease rate of the Gaussian filter. A smaller value results in less grainy images, but it may lead to over-smoothing images. Please refer to Appendix C in the DemoFusion paper.
- `sigma` (`float`, defaults to 1):
  The standard value of the Gaussian filter. A larger sigma promotes the global guidance of dilated sampling, but it has the potential of over-smoothing.
- `multi_decoder` (`bool`, defaults to True):
  Determine whether to use a tiled decoder. Generally, a tiled decoder becomes necessary when the resolution exceeds 3072*3072 on an RTX 3090 GPU.
- `show_image` (`bool`, defaults to False):
  Determine whether to show intermediate results during generation.

### Text2Image (will take about 17 GB of VRAM)
- Set up the dependencies as:
```
conda create -n demofusion python=3.9
conda activate demofusion
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Download `pipeline_demofusion_sdxl.py` and run it as follows. A use case can be found in `demo.ipynb`.
```
from pipeline_demofusion_sdxl import DemoFusionSDXLPipeline
import torch

model_ckpt = "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0"
pipe = DemoFusionSDXLPipeline.from_pretrained(model_ckpt, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

prompt = "Envision a portrait of an elderly woman, her face a canvas of time, framed by a headscarf with muted tones of rust and cream. Her eyes, blue like faded denim. Her attire, simple yet dignified."
negative_prompt = "blurry, ugly, duplicate, poorly drawn, deformed, mosaic"

images = pipe(prompt, negative_prompt=negative_prompt,
              height=3072, width=3072, view_batch_size=16, stride=64,
              num_inference_steps=50, guidance_scale=7.5,
              cosine_scale_1=3, cosine_scale_2=1, cosine_scale_3=1, sigma=0.8,
              multi_decoder=True, show_image=True
             )

for i, image in enumerate(images):
    image.save('image_' + str(i) + '.png')
```
- ‚ö†Ô∏è When you have enough VRAM (e.g., generating 2048*2048 images on hardware with more than 18GB RAM), you can set `multi_decoder=False`, which can make the decoding process faster.
- Please feel free to try different prompts and resolutions.
- Default hyper-parameters are recommended, but they may not be optimal for all cases. For specific impacts of each hyper-parameter, please refer to Appendix C in the DemoFusion paper.
- The code was cleaned before the release. If you encounter any issues, please contact us.

### Text2Image on Windows with 8 GB of VRAM

- Set up the environment as:

```
cmd
git clone "https://github.com/PRIS-CV/DemoFusion"
cd DemoFusion
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -U "xformers==0.0.22.post7+cu118" --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
pip install "diffusers==0.21.4" "matplotlib==3.8.2" "transformers==4.35.2" "accelerate==0.25.0"
```

- Launch DemoFusion as follows. The use case can be found in `demo_lowvram.py`.

```
python
from pipeline_demofusion_sdxl import DemoFusionSDXLPipeline

import torch
from diffusers.models import AutoencoderKL
vae = AutoencoderKL.from_pretrained("madebyollin/sdxl-vae-fp16-fix", torch_dtype=torch.float16)

model_ckpt = "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0"
pipe = DemoFusionSDXLPipeline.from_pretrained(model_ckpt, torch_dtype=torch.float16, vae=vae)
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

prompt = "Envision a portrait of an elderly woman, her face a canvas of time, framed by a headscarf with muted tones of rust and cream. Her eyes, blue like faded denim. Her attire, simple yet dignified."
negative_prompt = "blurry, ugly, duplicate, poorly drawn, deformed, mosaic"

images = pipe(prompt, negative_prompt=negative_prompt,
              height=2048, width=2048, view_batch_size=4, stride=64,
              num_inference_steps=40, guidance_scale=7.5,
              cosine_scale_1=3, cosine_scale_2=1, cosine_scale_3=1, sigma=0.8,
              multi_decoder=True, show_image=False, lowvram=True
             )

for i, image in enumerate(images):
    image.save('image_' + str(i) + '.png')
```
### Text2Image with local Gradio demo
- Make sure you have installed `gradio` and `gradio_imageslider`.
- Launch DemoFusion via Gradio demo now -- try `python gradio_demo.py`! Better Interaction and PresentationÔºÅ
<img src="figures/gradio_demo.png" width="600"/>

### Image2Image with local Gradio demo
- Make sure you have installed `gradio` and `gradio_imageslider`.
- Launch DemoFusion Image2Image by `python gradio_demo_img2img.py`.

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Please note that, as a tuning-free framework, DemoFusion's Image2Image capability is strongly correlated with the SDXL's training data distribution and will show a significant bias. An accurate prompt to describe the content and style of the input also significantly improves performance. Have fun and regard it as a side application of text+image based generation.
